# data scientist job
(1) Briefly describe the content of the graph. What does this graph show?

This graph shows us data scientists job statistics in 10 different cities colored by each cities.

(2) State the patterns obtained from the graph.

The median income of data scientists is postively related to overall median income in each city.

The median pay of data scientists is highest in San Francisco and there are hugh gaps between the first and the second cities.

Houston, Chicago and Atlanta those three cities have relatively low data scientists median income, and low average median income, population, cpi and relatively high crime rate.

Cities with high all median income tend to have low population, vice versa

(3) Try to explain the pattern. 

One reason that San Francisco has the highest data scientist income maybe due to the high median income of all jobs in San Francisco. This may indicate that San Francisco is more developed than other cities. We can also see that working in San Francisco would feel safer than in others cities. However, this comes at some expense. The price level is San Francisco is the highest among all the cities.

(4) What can we learn from the pattern, if any? 
What can see that for data scientists job, the high pay cities is San Francisco, DC, Seattle, New York, and Los Angeles. In those cities, all cities have high price levels. Thus it may be a huge live burden. Some of the cities have high population with low crime rate, such as nyc. Some if the cities have low population but with high crime rate, such as DC. Thus the situations in cities are different and we should choose the city according to our preference.



```{r}
df["west_or_east"]=c("m","e","w","e","m","w","w","m","e","e")

  parcoords(
    data=df[order(df$median_income),][-1,] %>% standardize()%>% column_to_rownames('city') ,
    rownames = T 
    , brushMode = "1D-axes"
    , reorderable = T
    , queue = T
    , color = list(
      colorBy = "west_or_east"
      ,colorScale = "scaleOrdinal"

```
(1) Briefly describe the content of the graph. What does this graph show?

This graph shows us data scientists job statistics in 10 different cities colored by geographic locations (west, middle or east).

(2) State the patterns obtained from the graph.
From this graph we can see that cities from middle part of us tend to have low cpi,high violent crime rate, low population, low data scientists median income and low overall median income.

Cities from west part of us tend to have high cpi, low violent crime rate, high data scientists median income and high overall median income.

The situations in east cities are more spreadout.

(3) Try to explain the pattern. 

One reasons that cities in the middle have low data scientists maybe that the overall median income is lower than cities in other part of US.

(4) What can we learn from the pattern, if any?
From this graph we can learn that as a data scientist, if we want to gain more, we need to avoid working in middle part of US and in Philadelphia.

From this graph we can see that cities from middle part of us tend to have low cpi,high violent crime rate, low population, low data analyst median income and low overall median income.

Cities from west part of us tend to have high cpi, low violent crime rate, high data scientists median income and high overall median income.

The situations in east cities are more spreadout.

San Francisco	has the highest data analyst median income. The cities in CA tend to have higher median income.

One reasons that cities in the middle have low data analyst maybe that the overall median income is lower than cities in other part of US.

(1) Briefly describe the content of the graph. What does this graph show?

This graph shows us the median income of three jobs (data scientist, data analyst and business analyst) vs statistics of 10 different cities. We are only interesting in the first column since we want to compare the median income of three job vs statistics of cities.

(2) State the patterns obtained from the graph.

median income of those three job is postively related to cpi and over all median income and no relation to population and violent_crime.

(3) Try to explain the pattern. 

I think this makes sense since the higher the overall median income, the higher the income of our three jobs.
Also, the higher the median income, the more expensive people can afford goods, thus the cpi is higher.


(4) What can we learn from the pattern, if any?

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
