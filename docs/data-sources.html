This website has the monthly data from October, 2016 to November, 2019.</p>
<p>Each monthly dataset mainly contains the national and ten cities’ job opening number and median base pay for different type of jobs, for different industry and for different company sizes. The structure of the dataset can be shown in the graph:</p>

<p>We encountered a major problem dealing with this data source. Glassdoor restructured and updated the datasets while we are doing data analysis part and only the datasets from June, 2017 to March, 2019 are left as same formatted and structured, so we only use the 22 months’ datasets when conducting data analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="indeed" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Indeed</h2>
<p>Since the dataset from glassdoor contain only job openings in 10 cities, and we are also interested in the frequent words in the job descriptions of different job openings, more detailed dataset are needed.</p>
<p>Initially, we found that Indeed.com provides a <a href="https://opensource.indeedeng.io/api-documentation/docs/job-search/">job searching API</a>, which allow s users to get access to data about job openings. Its results would contain information about job titles, recruiting company and location. However, applications for token of this API failed, because we are not qualified. Then, we decided to scrape data from Indeed.com instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=data+sceintist&amp;l=New+York%2C+NY">Sample search results on Web</a></p>
<p>When searching on Indeed.com, users can filter the results with key words, job titles, location or companies. In the scraper pipeline, search results on job openings with title of “Data scientist”, “Data Analyst”, “Financial Analyst” and “Business Analyst” around the US were included. At the first phase, scraping results are like these:</p>
<p>Only a preview of the job description is included, because the complete content of job description text require extra web requests, for which we concerned about its cost to Indeed.com server.</p>
<p>However, the analysis of the preview is not satisfying, so in the next phase, we also scraped the complete job description. The complete job description page look like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?cmp=Biz2Credit-Inc.&amp;t=Data+Science+Manager&amp;jk=e7c5dc3b25111e1b&amp;sjdu=QwrRXKrqZ3CNX5W-O9jEveJgZ7DRbh_ySwPONsqRa9Y_P0u65BR9sswVPFKEuwHB-Scyziy6GodSDbmULzuMGw&amp;tk=1drtm5c5ep7ck800&amp;adid=320883392&amp;pub=4a1b367933fd867b19b072952f68dceb&amp;vjs=3">Sample detail page</a></p>
<p>In the search results, there exist a bunch of duplicates. That’s because Indeed repeatedly presented some sponsored results.</p>
<p>Eventually, the scraping results contain 4 files, each for search results of one job title in the US. Duplicates have been removed. A preview of the data is as below:</p>

We take on big problems to help drivers, riders, delivery partners, and eaters get moving in more than 600 cities around the world. | We welcome people from all backgrounds who seek the opportunity to help build a future where everyone and everything can move independently. If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let’s move the world forward, together. | About the Role | We’re looking for PhD intern candidates to join the Policy, Research &amp; Economics team in Summer 2020 (3 months). Our team conducts research that forms the foundation for business decisions and our policy positions and helps policymakers, thought leaders, and the general public gain a better understanding of our platform. We seek candidates with a strong background in economics, transportation research, or other quantitative social sciences. | There are three subgroups that are hiring interns: | The Business Economics team uses research to inform business strategy, operations, and product decisions. For instance, we know that the flexible work model is very valuable to Uber drivers (see Chen et al., Angrist et al.) and that dynamic pricing is vital in protecting the health and efficiency of the dispatch market (see Castillo et al.); however, it’s likely that consistency (e.g., of pricing or earnings) also carries some value for riders and drivers. What values should we put on these opposing virtues, and how should we alter the product to reflect them? | The Policy Economics team has ongoing projects with leading academics on topics such as labor market dynamics, occupational licensing, and the economics of marketplaces. We conduct rigorous research that places our business and driver-partners in the context of the economies in which Uber operates. | The Mobility Research team conducts research on topics such as public transportation, congestion, environmental impact, micromobility, travel behavior, and transportation equity. We have ongoing projects with academics, conduct our own data investigations, and support the public policy and communications teams with other public-facing data analysis.What You’ll Do | Develop and execute a piece of independent research that could be used to inform business decisions or the policy conversation | Conduct rigorous, careful statistical and econometric analysis in support of our research priorities | Develop assets (maps, visuals etc.) that explain our research for policy and communications needs | Communicate cross-functionally to understand the intersection of policy, product, legal, and operations | Present your results internally; in some cases, your project may be developed into a public-facing piece of work | What You’ll Need | PhD student currently in your fourth year or above in Economics, Statistics, Public Policy, Urban Planning, Transportation Research, or other quantitative social science. | 2+ years of quantitative research or data science experience | Strong data skills and the ability to learn to use tools such as SQL, Python, R, and GIS mapping tools to work efficiently at scale | The capacity to work independently and execute a research plan with minimal oversight | The ability to organize and synthesize analyses and communicate data insights with clarity | Enthusiasm for learning and growth | About the Team | The Policy, Research and Economics team, led by the Chief Economist, is responsible for addressing the thorny policy and business challenges impacting Uber globally. As a data scientist on this team, you would be expected to bring analytical and empirical rigor to bear on important questions relating to economics, transportation policy, and urban planning.
