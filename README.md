The report can be accessed [here](https://lijning.github.io/career-opportunities-analysis/).

## Reproducible workflow

All scripts contributing to the analysis have been included in the repository. Most of them are in the Rmd files. Python scripts are used to support the text analysis on job description, and they are also included.

## Project structure

- `data/raw` : original raw data files from their source
- `data/clean`: transformed clean datasets
- `others/resource`: pictures and other resource files used in the report
- `preprocess` : scripts that prepare the dataset
- `scripts` : supportive scripts, including Python files
