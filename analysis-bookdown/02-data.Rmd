One dataset we used is gathered from the Job Market Report from Glassdoor: https://www.glassdoor.com/research/job-market-report-historical/. This website has the monthly data from October, 2016 to November, 2019. 

Each monthly dataset mainly contains the national and ten cities’ job opening number and median base pay for different type of jobs, for different industry and for different company sizes. The structure of the dataset can be shown in the graph:

The dataset looks like:

```{r}
library(openxlsx)
df = read.xlsx("https://www.glassdoor.com/research/app/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/LPR_data-2019-03.xlsx")
head(df)
```

We encountered a major problem dealing with this data source. Glassdoor restructured and updated the datasets while we are doing data analysis part and only the datasets from June, 2017 to March, 2019 are left as same formatted and structured, so we only use the 22 months’ datasets when conducting data analysis.
